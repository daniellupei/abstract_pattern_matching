\begin{abstract}
Event-series pattern matching is a major component of large-scale data 
analytics pipelines enabling a wide range of system diagnostics tasks.
% (from tracing network bottlenecks to detecting security breaches). 
While existing solutions focus on the online scenario and expect 
their data to be (mostly) sorted on time, this is not the case in many 
situations where batch processing is preferable due to the large volume of data 
and where the physical layout has to meet wider system requirements. 
On map-reduce frameworks the consequence is an expensive ``shuffle the world'' 
stage wherein data are sorted and shuffled across the network.  
Moreover, existing systems treat the pattern matching engine as a black box 
which prevents them from optimizing the entire data analytics pipeline (and in 
particular, this costly shuffle).

We address these challenges two fold:
(i) we translate an expressive class of regular-expression like patterns to 
relational queries such that they can benefit from decades of progress in 
relational optimizers, and
(ii) we introduce the technique of {\em abstract pattern matching}, a linear 
time preprocessing step which, adapting ideas from symbolic execution and 
abstract interpretation, discards events from the input guaranteed not to 
appear in successful matches.  
Abstract pattern matching first computes in a conservative manner the 
output-relevant domain of every event variable in the pattern based on the 
(unary) predicates that reference it.
It then further refines these domains based on the structure of the pattern as 
well as its join predicates. 
The outcome is an {\em abstract filter} that when applied to the original 
stream excludes events that cannot form a complete match.

We implemented and applied {\em abstract pattern matching} in COSMOS/Scope to 
an industrial benchmark where we obtained up to 3 orders of magnitude reduction 
in shuffled data and 1.23x average speedup in total processing time.
% and 1.09x average speedup in end-to-end latency
