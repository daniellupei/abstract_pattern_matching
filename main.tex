\begin{abstract}
Event-series pattern matching is a major component of data analytics pipelines
enabling a wide range of system diagnostics tasks (from tracing network
bottlenecks to detecting security breaches). Existing pattern-matching engines
(e.g., Oracle's match recognize) expect their data to be sorted on time which is
not the case in many practical scenarios where the physical layout of the data
has to meet wider system requirements. This in turn leads to an expensive
``shuffle the world'' stage wherein data are sorted and shuffled across the
network.  Unfortunately, existing systems treat the pattern matching engine as a
black box which prevents these systems from optimizing the entire data analytics
pipeline (and in particular, this costly shuffle).

To solve this problem, we adapt ideas from symbolic execution and abstract
interpretation to filter data guaranteed not to match any pattern.  In
particular, we demonstrate how to view an expressive class of regular-expression
like patterns as relational calculus expressions.  On such a representation, we
then introduce the idea of symbolic pattern matching, a linear time
pre-processing step which filters out events from the input guaranteed not to
match the pattern.  Symbolic pattern matching relies on abstract domains to
first collect a set of conservative constraints for every transition of the
pattern based on the events from the input that may match it. It then uses these
transition constraints to perform a fixpoint computation over the state machine
representation of the pattern, during which it eliminates transition constraints
that cannot form a complete path, i.e., a path to a final state. Finally, the
original stream of events is filtered based on the resulting set of constraints.

We implemented and applied Symbolic pattern matching in SCOPE to an industrial
benchmark (subset of Asimov telemetry queries) where we obtained up to 3 orders
of magnitude reduction in shuffled data, 26\% average reduction in total
processing time and 18\% average reduction in end-to-end latency.
