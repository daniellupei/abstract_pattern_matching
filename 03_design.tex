\section{Design}

We consider patterns specified as a symbolic finite automata where each
transition has a guard (propositional formula) whose predicates test the
currently considered event against constants as well as events matched by
preceding transitions.
   
Pattern matching algorithms require data sorted on time.
In a map-reduce framework this makes the reducer the main bottleneck of the
analysis, both at the network level (large amounts of shuffled data) and at
the processing level (in case of data-skew).



We propose to significantly reduce the amount of data fed into the pattern
matcher (reducer) by dropping in a map phase all the events that cannot take
part in a successfull match.

To do so we design a set of filters that while conservative, closely match the
semantics of the patterns analysed.
We propose three levels of abstraction.
The first enforces the join constraints between different transitions as
expressed by join predicates within the transition guards.
The second one further imposes time windowing constraints (all events of a
successfull match must occur within a timeout of the first event in the match).
Finally the last one enforces ordering constraints between {\em consecutive}
transitions of the pattern.

In our approach we leverage the fact that a large class of symbolic finite
automata fit within the fragment of star-free languages which
have a corresponding FOL formula (possibly with counting quantifiers).
Whenever that is not the case we can narrow the scope of our filters to the
sections of the pattern that do.
 
We relax these FOL formulas to produce precise filters, one per transition, 
that can be evaluated independently on each mapper.
Finally we further coarsen these filters to a set of relaxed filters
that can be collected and tested in a time and space efficient manner (eg. bloom
filters, time-interval maps).

We explore the tradeoffs involved in the overheads incurred in building the
filters and their accuracy.
