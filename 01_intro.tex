\section{Introduction}

(Motivation) 
Event-series pattern matching is widely used for behavioral/anomaly/causality
analysis, for eg: network diagnostics, algorithmic
trading, security breach detection.


(Challenges)
Warehoused data is being analyzed by a wide range of queries thus it
may not be clustered/sorted on time. 

Analytics are being run both over fresh data as well as historical data,
therefore the data management system needs to support both online and
batching mode processing.


(Approach)
We design a set of relational-style optimizations for event-series pattern
matching workloads.

(Results)
We provide X reduction in shuffled data and Y reduction in end-to-end latency
for 3 workloads:
i) telemetry analysis over the events produced by the Windows event-reporting
infrastructure
ii) Github queries
iii) stock market algorithmic trading.
