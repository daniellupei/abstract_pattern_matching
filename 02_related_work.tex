Complex event processing has received extensive interest in the 
literature~\cite{SASE:2008,Akdere:2008,Brenna:2007,Cadonna:2011,Cadonna:2012,
	Demers:2007,Johnson:2007,Leghari:2015,Li:2007,Sadri:2004,SASE:2014,
	Raychev:2015} and 
has enjoyed similarly wide adoption in 
industry~\cite{esper_epl,oracle_mr,aster_npath,Carasso:2012},
with most of the work focused on online (near-real time) systems designed to 
deliver extremely low response times for mission-critical tasks (for eg., 
blocking a credit card upon detecting fraudulent activity). 
However, as the volume of data that needs to be processed continues to grow, 
online systems experience scalability issues considering that the 
pattern matching logic is typically implemented in a sequential manner.
